# aws_lambda-S3-SES

This is an event-driven Architecture where I used Lambda function, S3, and SES services that provided by AWS.

In this project, we integrate all three services together to create an event-based project when the user uploads a text or CSV or pdf file where the email Id is stored in the S3 bucket lambda function trigger then the lambda function calls the SES service, and send an email for each user.
